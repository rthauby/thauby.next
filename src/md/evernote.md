I had the privilege of working at [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com) as a Senior Software Engineer from October 2019 to February 2023. During my time at Evernote, I made significant contributions and achieved several noteworthy accomplishments that I am proud to share.

One of my key achievements was spearheading the development of a JavaScript version of Skitch, an image annotation tool embedded within the main React Native client. This involved meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that the code was well-architected, well-documented, and of the highest quality. I took great pride in delivering exceptional results within tight deadlines.

In addition to my work on Skitch, I also played a vital role in maintaining and submitting browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. This required a deep understanding of the different browser ecosystems and meticulous testing to ensure seamless integration with Evernote's platform.

I took the initiative to establish client health monitoring via DataDog, enabling us to proactively identify and address potential issues. This contributed to a more stable and reliable user experience, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction.

Furthermore, I took charge of debugging build and deployment workflows in Jenkins for App Store submissions. This attention to detail ensured a smooth submission process and helped streamline the release cycle.

Through close collaboration with the Product team, I played a key role in creating detailed roadmaps that resulted in increasingly accurate forecasting and scheduling. This strategic partnership allowed us to align our engineering efforts with business goals effectively.

Due to my outstanding performance, I was promoted to Engineering Manager for the "Out of App" team. In this role, I successfully led the team responsible for the iOS Share Extension, Chrome extension (Web Clipper), and Outlook plugin for Evernote. I provided guidance and support to my team members, fostering a culture of ownership and driving continuous improvement.

In recognition of my leadership skills and strong performance, I was asked to take over the Growth and Activation team. Here, I crafted experiments utilizing a combination of in-house services and third-party solutions to increase user activation numbers. These initiatives led to measurable improvements and contributed to the overall growth of Evernote's user base.

Beyond my technical accomplishments, I also excelled in talent management. I had a proven track record of recruiting, developing, and retaining talented individuals, contributing to a high-performing team.

By fostering a culture of ownership and continuous improvement, I successfully improved processes, resulting in increased productivity and three individual contributors receiving well-deserved promotions.

Throughout my tenure at Evernote, my achievements were driven by a passion for excellence and a commitment to delivering exceptional results. I am grateful for the opportunities I had to make a meaningful impact, and I look forward to bringing my expertise and achievements to future endeavors.
